# Weather App

## Description

This weather web app is meant to help users who may be traveling to different cities search the current weather and the five-day forecast of the destination. It uses the OpenWeatherAPI to retrieve the relevant weather and forecast data. Every city the user searches for is added to a list of buttons, which, when clicked, will also display the current weather and forecast information. 

## User Story

## Acceptance Criteria

```
